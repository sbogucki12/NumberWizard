# Number Wizard

## Gameplay

This is a console game where the user thinks of a number between 1 and 1,000.  The computer than identifies the number via a series of guesses. 

## Background

Having graduated a coding academy and (mostly) completed a great C# Fundamentals Course on Udemy (link below), I desired to apply my skills.  The Unity game engine uses C#, so I want to build a game.  I want to build a few games.  Specifically, to begin with, a game where the player navigates a trail (or mountain) and at certain checkpoints is presented real-world photography of beautiful topographical images.  Eventually, I want to build a game that depicts some of my war-time experiences in the video game format. 

For now, I am using another Udemy course that teaches the student how to develop with the Unity game engine.  The link to that course is also below.  This game, Number Wizard, is created via guidance from that course.
